I'm a research engineer in Huawei Cloud with a focus on serverless, cloud native and distributed systems. I'm also interested in the advancement of AI infra and LLMs.  

I received the joint Ph.D. degree in industrial engineering, supervised by [Prof. Min Xie](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/sye/minxie.htm), City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, and also in management science, supervised by [Prof. Xiaoyan Zhu](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0032929), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, in 2021. 

Before that I received the B.S. degree in mathematics and the B.E. double degree in ecomomics from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 2016.
