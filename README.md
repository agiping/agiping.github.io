# About Me
![](WechatIMG651.jpg)

I'm a research engineer in Huawei Cloud with a focus on serverless, cloud native and distributed systems. I'm also interested in the advancement of AI infra and LLMs.  

I received the joint Ph.D. degree in industrial engineering with the Department of System Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, and also in management science and engineering with the School of Economics and Management, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, in 2021. Before that I received the B.S. degree in mathematics and the B.E. double degree in ecomomics from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 2016.
